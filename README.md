# csse332-sp2324-review-session1

## How to download and edit the files here:
First, create a new directory on your WSL. You can do this by running the following command:
``` 
mkdir <directory name>
```
Once you've done that, go ahead and cd into the directory. Then, you'll want to go ahead and run the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:wynessgp/git@github.com:wynessgp/csse332-sp2324-review-session1.git
```
And that should go ahead and move all of the files over to your WSL. My suggestion is you keep all the review sessions material in this directory, as they'll be nicely organized. Note that you could also just directly clone this repo from your home directory, and the file that comes out of that will just be the repo's name. 

If you are having errors with GitHub saying it cannot authenticate you due to a publickey issue, you'll need to create a SSH key. You can either follow the instructions on [GitHub's website](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate one, or you can follow Comp Arch 1's tutorial [here](comp-arch-ssh-tutorial.md). Note that the Comp Arch 1 tutorial talks about using `Git Bash` -- you'll need to do all of those steps in WSL instead, so do it on your Ubuntu machine! 

If that is not the error, I'd suggest following whatever the console spits out - those hints usually tell you everything you need.

I'd recommend leaving this README page up on [GitHub](https://github.com/wynessgp/csse332-sp2324-review-session1) and tabbing back and forth for instructions. If you are viewing this in VSCode, note that to render markdowns, you can do `Ctrl + k, v` (in that order), although you shouldn't ever open VSCode for this class (you certainly won't be allowed to on the Exams). I have tried to leave you some nice links that you can click on for some navigability. 

## A quick request
If you are going to ask me questions related to this practice exam after the review session, please see me for my regularly scheduled hours within the next 2 weeks:
- (Percopo 2 Study Room) Thursday night, 3/21, from 7-10pm.
- (Percopo 0 Classroom) Monday night, 3/25, from 7-10pm.
- (Percopo 0 Classroom) Wednesday night, 3/27, from 7-10pm.
- (Percopo 2 Study Room) Thursday night, 3/28, from 7-10pm. 

I am not too keen on hopping on Teams calls or responding to messages outside of my regularly scheduled hours, as I too have assignments that I need to do. Study room hours and classroom hours are specific times the SRTs set aside for you to come and ask us questions or get help!
